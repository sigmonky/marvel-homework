Marvel Homework -- Submitted by Randy Weinstein 12/3/19

Dependencies used:
None. I thought the project scope and timeline did not warrant inclusion of dependencies.

I did make extensive use of this API solution: 
https://github.com/victorpimentel/MarvelAPI

I did some modest refatoring on the above solution to flesh out the comicbook view model and vet its injection into a generic class proxing for the view controller. That is all embodied in the Marvel API playground included in this repo along with the homework project.
